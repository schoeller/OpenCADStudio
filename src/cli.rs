//! Command-line interface.

//! Parsing lives here; `main` interprets the result. Three run modes split out
//! of the parsed args:
//!   - `--serve`            headless JSON automation server (see `app::serve`)
//!   - `--export IN OUT`    one-shot headless format conversion, then exit
//!   - otherwise            launch the GUI editor, configured via [`GuiConfig`]
//!
//! GUI-only options (open-file, `--new`, `--read-only`, `--script`) are stashed
//! in [`GUI_CONFIG`] for `app::boot` to read, since the iced daemon boots with
//! no arguments of its own.
